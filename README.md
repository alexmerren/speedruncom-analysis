# Analysing the Communities of Speedrun.com

![](https://www.speedrun.com/images/logo-white.png)

This repository contains all the information related to the final project of my undergraduate degree. 

This repository is comprised of three main parts, the data collection, the data analysis, and the data itself. Throughout the collection and analysis I am using Python and related modules for the functionality. 

The data can be found in the [data](/data) directory. In this, we can find the [general information about games](/data/games_information), the [other games users play](/data/related_games), and the [world record history](/data/world_record_history) for each game.

I will continue to update this repository when developments are made. I expect the final version of the analysis will be available in late April.

## Thanks

A big thank you to [blha303](https://github.com/blha303) for creating the [srcomapi repository](https://github.com/blha303/srcomapi). It has saved me countless hours creating my own wrapper for the API, you have my thanks!
