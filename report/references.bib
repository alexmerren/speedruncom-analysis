    abstract = { The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives in many ways, including how we choose to spend our time and deal with unprecedented circumstances. Anecdotal reports suggest that many have turned to playing video games during the pandemic. To better understand how games are being used during the lockdown, we conducted an online survey (N = 781) that focused on gameplay habits and effects on players’ well-being. We find that time spent playing games has increased for 71\% of respondents, while 58\% of respondents reported that playing games has impacted their well-being, with the overwhelming majority of responses indicating a positive impact. We identify seven ways that games have affected players, such as providing cognitive stimulation and opportunities to socialise, and a variety of benefits related to mental health, including reduced anxiety and stress. Our findings highlight the sociocultural significance of video games and the potentially positive nature of games’ effects on well-being. }

    abstractNote={The microblogging service Twitter is one of the world’s most popular online social networks and assembles a huge amount of data produced by interactions between users. A careful analysis of this data allows identifying groups of users who share similar traits, opinions, and preferences. We call community detection the process of user group identification, which grants valuable insights not available upfront. In order to extract useful knowledge from Twitter data many methodologies have been proposed, which define the attributes to be used in community detection problems by manual and empirical criteria - oftentimes guided by the aimed type of community and what the researcher attaches importance to. However, such approach cannot be generalized because it is well known that the task of finding out an appropriate set of attributes leans on context, domain, and data set. Aiming to the advance of community detection domain, reduce computational cost and improve the quality of related researches, this paper proposes a standard methodology for community detection in Twitter using feature selection methods. Results of the present research directly affect the way community detection methodologies have been applied to Twitter and quality of outcomes produced.},

It then applies traditional network centric community detection techniques to identify clusters of users. The paper also approaches the issues of dynamicity and evolution in Social Media by developing a Bayesian classiﬁer that maps new users to the detected communities. Using a data set of UK political Tweets, we evaluate the factors affecting the quality of the detected communities. We also investigate how the accuracy of the classiﬁer is affected by the dynamicity of the network evolution and the time elapsed between community detection and classiﬁer application.},

    abstractNote={All online sharing systems gather data that reﬂects users’ collective behavior and their shared activities. This data can be used to extract different kinds of relationships which can be grouped into layers and which are basic components of the multidimensional social network (MSN) proposed in the paper. The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e., direct and object-based ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their proﬁles were identiﬁed and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the ‘Flickr’ population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the ‘Flickr’ photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of this paper is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users’ needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the MSN. The conducted experiments conﬁrmed the usefulness of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we examine various entities, such as steamers and gaming franchises, in Twitch and how they interact with each other. Using Twitch’s API services, we first collect data about Twitch entities and then use this data to answer two interesting questions: i) what game franchises attract similar audiences, and ii) how connected/segregated are different predominate subcultures of gamers. To capture the structural relationships, we classify game streamers into three types and develop two novel community visualization methods. These methods help to gain insight into the connectivity and trends of this online community. Our research uncovers valuable information on better understanding gaming communities.},

    and analysis of networks and network algorithms.
    The core package provides data structures
    for representing many types of networks, or graphs,
    including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs
    with parallel edges and self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX
    graphs can be any (hashable) Python object
    and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility
    makes NetworkX ideal for representing networks
    found in many different scientific fields.
    In addition to the basic data structures many graph
    algorithms are implemented for calculating network
    properties and structure measures: shortest paths,
    betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution
    and many more. NetworkX can read and
    write various graph formats for easy exchange with
    existing data, and provides generators for many
    classic graphs and popular graph models, such as
    the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert
    models.
    The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming
    language together with connection to the
    SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific

    abstractNote={With the advent of the era of big data, data mining has become one of the key technologies in the field of research and business. In order to improve the efficiency of data mining, this paper studies data mining based on the intelligent recommendation system. Firstly, this paper makes mathematical modeling of the intelligent recommendation system based on association rules. After analyzing the requirements of the intelligent recommendation system, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, technology is used to divide the system architecture into the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data layer. Recommendation module is divided into three substages: data representation, model learning, and recommendation engine. Then, the fuzzy clustering algorithm is used to optimize the system. After the system is built, the performance of the system is evaluated, and the evaluation indexes include accuracy, coverage, and response time. Finally, the system is put into a trial operation of an e-commerce platform. The click-through rate and purchase conversion rate of recommended products before and after the operation are compared, and a questionnaire survey is randomly launched to the platform users to analyze the user satisfaction. The experimental data show that the MAE of this system is the lowest, maintained at about 0.73, and its accuracy is the highest; before the recommended threshold exceeds 0.5, the average coverage rate of this system is the highest: 0.75; in Q1&#x2013;Q5 subsets, the shortest response time of the system is 0.2&#x2009;s. Before and after the operation of the system, the average click-through rate increased by 11.04&#x0025;, and the average purchase rate increased by 9.35&#x0025;. Among the 1216 users, 43&#x0025; of the users were satisfied with 4 and 9&#x0025; with 1. This shows that the system algorithm convergence speed is fast; it can recommend products more in line with user needs and interests and promote higher click-through rate and purchase rate, but user satisfaction can be further improved.}, journal={Mathematical Problems in Engineering},

    abstractNote={The modern science of networks has made significant advancement in the modeling of complex real-world systems. One of the most important features in these networks is the existence of community structure. In recent years, many community detection algorithms have been proposed to unveil the structural properties and dynamic behaviors of networks. In this study, we attempt a contemporary survey on the methods of community detection and its applications in the various domains of real life. Besides highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each community detection approach, different aspects of algorithmic performance comparison and their testing on standard benchmarks are discussed. The challenges faced by community detection algorithms, open issues and future trends related to community detection are also postulated. The main goal of this paper is to put forth a review of prevailing community detection algorithms that range from traditional algorithms to state of the art algorithms for overlapping community detection. Algorithms based on dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) are also focused. This study will serve as an up-to-date report on the evolution of community detection and its potential applications in various domains from real world networks.},

In this article we present an explanation of how recommender systems are related to some traditional database analysis techniques. We examine how recommender systems help E-commerce sites increase sales and analyze the recommender systems at six market-leading sites. Based on these examples, we create a taxonomy of recommender systems, including the inputs required from the consumers, the additional knowledge required from the database, the ways the recommendations are presented to consumers, the technologies used to create the recommendations, and the level of personalization of the recommendations. We identify ﬁve commonly used E-commerce recommender application models, describe several open research problems in the ﬁeld of recommender systems, and examine privacy implications of recommender systems technology.}, booktitle={Applications of Data Mining to Electronic Commerce}, publisher={Springer US}, author={Schafer, J.

        abstract = {This thesis is concerned with speedrunning, the practice of completing a video game as quickly as possible without the use of cheats or cheat devices as well as the community of players that unite around this sort of play. As video games become increasingly ubiquitous in popular media and culture, the project of accounting for and analysing how people interact with these pieces of software becomes more relevant than ever before. As such, this thesis emerges as an initiatory treatment of a relatively niche segment of game culture that has gone underrepresented in extant game and media scholarship. The text begins by discussing speedrunning as a community. By chronicling the community's beginnings on SpeedDemosArchive.com and examining its growth with the emergence of contemporary content hosting sites like YouTube and Twitch, this thesis presents speedrunning as a collaborative and fast-growing community of practice made up of players who revel in playing games quickly. From there, an analysis of space and speed, both natural and virtual, is undertaken with a view to understanding how speedrunning as a practice relates to games as narrative spaces. Discussions of rule systems in games and within the speedrunning community itself follow. It is ultimately argued that speedrunning is a museum of accidents, a re-curating of a game according to what this thesis calls its explicit rules. This claim is expanded upon through the coining of a concept dubbed curatorial play as well as several case studies of developer responses to various games being speedrun.},

In challenging traditional ideas of a hegemonic, unified community, I seek to bring in theories outside of community formation to present different ways to think about and with community formation.  By interviewing speedrunners, I highlight how speedrunning does not form concrete communities with rigid social structures, but instead assemblages of individuals that co-create through a collaborative practice.  Looking at social groups in this way can help us better understand how people in these groups can remain an individual collaborating with other individuals without being forced to conform to predetermined social expectations or structures.},

Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity.

As the tools for doing these simpliﬁcations proliferate within the network literature, researchers would beneﬁt from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that diﬀerent methods highlight diﬀerent aspects of a network’s structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system’s network structure was formed, as we are in how a network’s extant structure inﬂuences the system’s behavior. To see how structure inﬂuences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry ﬂow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this ﬂow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this ﬂow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. The diﬀerences between the map equation and the modularity maximization approach are not merely conceptual. Because the map equation attends to patterns of ﬂow on the network and the modularity maximization approach does not, the two methods can yield dramatically diﬀerent results for some network structures. To illustrate this and build our understanding of each method, we partition several sample networks. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to eﬃciently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.}, number={1}, journal={The European Physical Journal Special Topics}, author={Rosvall, M. and Axelsson, D. and Bergstrom, C.

    abstract = { Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve. }

For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.}, number={1}, journal={Social Networks}, author={Borgatti, Stephen P.}, year={2005}, pages={55–71} }

Collaborative ﬁltering is a widely accepted technique to generate recommendations based on the ratings of like-minded users. However, it suffers from several inherent issues such as data sparsity and cold start. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called ‘“Merge”’ to incorporate social trust information (i.e., trusted neighbors explicitly speciﬁed by users) in providing recommendations. Speciﬁcally, ratings of a user’s trusted neighbors are merged to complement and represent the preferences of the user and to ﬁnd other users with similar preferences (i.e., similar users). In addition, the quality of merged ratings is measured by the conﬁdence considering the number of ratings and the ratio of conﬂicts between positive and negative opinions. Further, the rating conﬁdence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for a given item is generated by aggregating the ratings of similar users. Experimental results based on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms other counterparts both in terms of accuracy and coverage.}, journal={Knowledge-Based Systems}, author={Guo, Guibing and Zhang, Jie and Thalmann, Daniel}, year={2014}, month={Feb}, pages={57–68}, language={en} }
